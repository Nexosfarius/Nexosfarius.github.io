      <h1 style="text-align:center;"> &#128206 Basic Information &#128206 </h1>
      <p> My name is Mohammed Buksh but I prefer to go by my middle name Tahir.
        While my current major is Computer Science, my previous major was Biomedical Science.
        I changed to Computer Science over the 2021 summer vacation so I am very new to the field of coding and computers.
        I"m 20 years old as of this past December and my current goals in college are to explore the field of computer science to see where I would like to work in the future.

      <h1 style="text-align:center;"> &#128736 Experience &#128736 </h1>
      <ul>  <li> Study Abroad in Japan: During the summer of 2017, I studied abroad in Japan where I met with and spoke often with locals to learn the language efficiently.
        I also helped locals collect and dispose of cans and garbage by walking around neighborhoods picking up bags and taking them to a local park where they gatbage and recycling would be sorted.
        I also worked with students ranging from college age to elentary school age to learn how to better communicate ideas even if I am unfamiliar with the language and the people being spoken to are not used to the ideas being presented. </li>
        <li> Lab Work: For the first 2 years of college, while I was in the Biomedical Sciences major, I was able to gain a lot of lab experience where I worked both in groups and separately to conduct and write reports on experiments done in class.
        From this, I also learned how to work in fast-paced environments with dangerous substances being nearby. I also learned to handle volatile substances with care and to perform research on those substances before and after the experients.</li>
